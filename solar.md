[Single diode](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-single-diode-model-of-a-practical-photovoltaic-device_fig1_278829680) solar PV mathematical models are investigated for this study. The value of solar PV module voltage (*Vspv*) is expressed by *Eq. (1) (Thapar et al., 2011)*:
- *Vspv = Vmppt [1 + 0.0539 log (Gtt(t)/Gst)] + α (Ta(t)) + 0.02 Gtt(t)*    (1)
where, *Vmppt* as the maximum power point voltage (in Volts),
*α* as the co-efficient of temperature,
*Gtt* as the measured value of irradiation (in kW/m2),
*Gst* as the standard value of irradiation (in 1 kW/m2), and
*Ta* as the variable temperature (K).

Output current of a solar PV system (Ispv) is obtained by *Eq. (2)*:
- *Ispv(t) = Iph(t) − Irs (t) [exp (qVPv/Ns K Ta(t) Ai) − 1]*    (2)
where, *Iph* is the photocurrent, *Irs* as the saturation current, *q* as the charging of the electrons, *Ns* as the number of series cells, *K* as the Boltzmann’s constant, and *Ai* as the ideal diode factor.

Total energy generated by solar PV system (Espv) is expressed by *Eq. (3)*:
- *Espv (t) = (Nspv × Vspv(t) × Ispv (t) × Δt)/1000*    (3)
where *Nspv* as the number of PV modules and *Δt* as the step time as 15 min.

The hourly output power of the PV generator with an area 𝐴𝑝𝑣(𝑚2) at a solar radiation on tilted plane module 𝐺𝑡(𝑊/𝑚2), is given by:
- 𝑃𝑝𝑣= 𝜂𝑝𝑣× 𝐴𝑝𝑣×𝐺𝑡 (4)
where 𝜂𝑝𝑣 represents the PV generator efficiency and is given by:
- 𝜂𝑝𝑣= 𝜂𝑟×𝜂𝑝𝑐×(1−β(𝑇𝑐−𝑇𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑓)) (5)
where 𝜂𝑟 is the reference module efficiency, 𝜂𝑝𝑐 is the power conditioning efficiency which is equal to 1 if a perfect maximum power tracker (MPPT) is used. β is the generator efficiency temperature coefficient, it is assumed to be a constant and for silicon cells the range of β is 0.004–0.006 per (°C), 𝑇𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑓 is the reference cell temperature (°C) and 𝑇𝑐 is the cell temperature (°C) and can be calculated as follows:
- 𝑇𝑐= T + (( NOCT − 20)/ 800)×𝐺𝑡 (6)
where T is the ambient temperature (°C) and NOCT is the nominal cell operating temperature (°C). 𝜂𝑝𝑐, β, NOCT and 𝐴𝑝𝑣 , are parameters that depend upon the type of module used. The data are obtained from the PV module manufacturers.
