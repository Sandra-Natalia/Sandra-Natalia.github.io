and [software package](https://timjmiller.github.io/wham/), which combines these two approaches. WHAM can estimate time- and age-varying random effects on annual transitions in numbers at age, natural mortality, and selectivity, as well as fit environmental time-series with process and observation errors, missing data, and nonlinear links to recruitment and natural mortality. WHAM can also be configured as a traditional statistical catch-at-age model in order to easily bridge from status quo models and test them against models with state-space and environmental effects, all within a single framework.

[Single diode](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-single-diode-model-of-a-practical-photovoltaic-device_fig1_278829680) solar PV mathematical models are investigated for this study. The value of solar PV module voltage (*Vspv*) is expressed by *Eq. (1) (Thapar et al., 2011)*:
- Vspv = Vmppt [1 + 0.0539 log (Gtt(t)/Gst)] + α (Ta(t)) + 0.02 Gtt(t) (1)
where, Vmppt as the maximum power point voltage (in Volts),
α as the co-efficient of temperature,
Gtt as the measured value of irradiation (in kW/m2),
Gst as the standard value of irradiation (in 1 kW/m2), and
Ta as the variable temperature (K).

Output current of a solar PV system (Ispv) is obtained by Eq. (2):
- Ispv(t) = Iph(t) − Irs (t) [exp (qVPv/Ns K Ta(t) Ai) − 1] (2)
where, Iph is the photo current, Irs as the saturation current, q as the charging of the electrons, Ns as the number of series cells, K as the Boltzmann’s constant, and Ai as the ideal diode factor.

Total energy generated by solar PV system (Espv) is expressed by Eq. (3):
- Espv (t) = (Nspv × Vspv(t) × Ispv (t) × Δt)/1000 (3)
where Nspv as the number of PV modules and Δt as the step time as 15 min.

The hourly output power of the PV generator with an area 𝐴𝑝𝑣(𝑚2) at a solar radiation on tilted plane module 𝐺𝑡(𝑊/𝑚2), is given by:
- 𝑃𝑝𝑣= 𝜂𝑝𝑣× 𝐴𝑝𝑣×𝐺𝑡 (4)
where 𝜂𝑝𝑣 represents the PV generator efficiency and is given by:
- 𝜂𝑝𝑣= 𝜂𝑟×𝜂𝑝𝑐×(1−β(𝑇𝑐−𝑇𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑓)) (5)
where 𝜂𝑟 is the reference module efficiency, 𝜂𝑝𝑐 is the power conditioning efficiency which is equal to 1 if a perfect maximum power tracker (MPPT) is used. β is the generator efficiency temperature coefficient, it is assumed to be a constant and for silicon cells the range of β is 0.004–0.006 per (°C), 𝑇𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑓 is the reference cell temperature (°C) and 𝑇𝑐 is the cell temperature (°C) and can be calculated as follows:
- 𝑇𝑐= T + (( NOCT − 20)/ 800)×𝐺𝑡 (6)
where T is the ambient temperature (°C) and NOCT is the nominal cell operating temperature (°C). 𝜂𝑝𝑐, β, NOCT and 𝐴𝑝𝑣 , are parameters that depend upon the type of module used. The data are obtained from the PV module manufacturers.

### Random effects with 2D autocorrelation (age x year)

State-space assessment models can estimate stochastic deviations in survival, which represent variability in some ambiguous combination of natural mortality (*M*), fishing mortality (*F*), and migration. These survival deviations are generally treated as independent by age and year, even though many population processes can be autocorrelated and not accounting for autocorrelation can result in notable bias. We incorporated two-dimensional (2D, age and year) first-order autocorrelation in survival and *M* into the assessment for Southern New England-Mid Atlantic yellowtail flounder. Models with 2D autocorrelation fit the data better and had reduced retrospective pattern than models without autocorrelation.
