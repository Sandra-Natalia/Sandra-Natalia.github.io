[MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) is a programming platform designed specifically for engineers and scientists to analyze and design systems and products that transform our world. The heart of MATLAB is the MATLAB language, a matrix-based language that allows the most natural expression of computational mathematics.

MATLAB lets you take your ideas from research to production by deploying to enterprise applications and embedded devices, as well as integrating with SimulinkÂ® and Model-Based Design.

Millions of engineers and scientists worldwide use MATLAB for a range of applications, in industry and academia, including deep learning and machine learning, signal processing and communications, image and video processing, control systems, test and measurement, computational finance, and computational biology.

[Genetic algorithm (GA)](https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/genetic-algorithm.html?s_tid=srchtitle_site_search_2_genetic%20algorithm) is an advanced search and optimization technique. It has been developed to imitate the evolutionary principle of natural genetics. Compared with traditional methods (the direct exhaustive search method and the gradient-directed search method) for function optimization, one of the main advantages of the GA is that it is generally robust in finding globally optimal solutions, particularly in multimodal and multi-objective optimization problems. Genetic algorithm is used for determining constraints-based optimization problems. Genetic algorithm accomplishes a number of computations in each iteration depending on population size, selection procedure, and crossover & mutation rate to generate the new population (Rajanna and Saini, 2016a). Genetic algorithm is developed into MATLAB software. In optimization problems, the M-file was implemented with constraints, variables, and constants as an objective function. The variables considered in the proposed system are WTG, SPV, and Battery. GA toolbox is used to optimize problems to find out the fitness function. Based on the results it was found that the specified functions are considered in a minimum number of generations. Also, the numbers of components are carried out to find the crossover and mutation rate, and selection process.
