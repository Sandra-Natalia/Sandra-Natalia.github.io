### Renewable Energy
Renewable energy provides major benefits that should be taken seriously. Learn more about renewable energy and how you can help reduce emissions with this guide!

As the world faces more extreme weather events and Canada strives to reach its climate goals, renewable energy is becoming an increasingly important part of the global energy mix. By choosing renewable sources of electricity, you can help reduce emissions, create jobs, and lower your bills. 

**Renewable energy** is defined as energy that comes from natural, sustainably managed sources, such as the sun, wind, water, and biomass. It has lower greenhouse gas emissions than traditional fossil fuel technologies and its use expands economic opportunities while helping to reduce climate change. Renewable sources accounted for nearly 23% of global final energy consumption in 2019.

### Types of Renewable
Renewable energy technologies are clean sources of energy that use resources that can be replenished or regenerated. These technologies include solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biomass, and tidal. These sources offer several advantages over traditional fossil fuels such as cost-effectiveness and the ability to generate electricity with minimal emissions and pollution. Moreover, renewable energy sources provide a secure source of power and minimize dependence on foreign fuel supplies.

### Cost-effectiveness & Financial Incentives for Solar & Wind Power
Renewable energy sources like wind and solar power have become increasingly cost-effective as technology advances. Governments provide incentives like tax breaks, grants, and feed-in tariffs for investing in renewable energy systems. This makes it easier (and more affordable) for households and businesses to switch over to sustainable alternatives.
